// =============================================================================


// Register responsive breakpoints for your application here. These will
// be used to generate classes for the grid system and responsive utilities.
// Sonata provides some sensible defaults based on the major third scale.
//
// You can remove or add as many as you want, but try to include only
// those that you will be using, especially if you generate responsive
// utility classes (which Sonata does by default) as this will increase
// the compiled file size significantly.
//
// Use pixel based widths.
